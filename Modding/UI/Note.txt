Modding UI
====================================================================
Introduction

Modding is very sensitive!! 
your mod have to contain the folder name and organize same with
original path

ex. original folder path is "BNSR/Content/Art/UI/GameUI"
	but your mod folder path is "BNS/Art/GameUI" 
	Your mod will not working!!
	because you folder name not same with original path
	game engine can't read your mod !!

=====================================================================
How to modding ( recreate for another mod )

 You can find the original path in folder "pak_filelist_UE4_3"
 by open all of them in notepad++ and Ctrl + F  Seach keyword all of file

  the original ui path is "BNSR/Content/Art/UI/..."

 but the easy way to mod is " recreate(edit) from another mod "
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1)	take file .pak of mod that you need to edit to unpack with unrealPack
	if you use my BluePrint skip to step 5

2)  then you will get some of asset (file .uasset) 

!!!! Warnning !!!!!
- if you extract .pak file from unrealPack "you Can't replace them back"
	the repack file (.pak) will not working
	because the repack file have some path not same with original path.
	to fix it 
	" you have to create the folder and organize same with original path"

3) open the folder that already unpack to the "umodel"

4) then you can export the .uasset to .TGA(picture file) by click Export 
	!! don't forget to change texture format to "TGA (uncompressed) "
		befor export. it make you get master quality !! 

5) after you get .TGA  you can edit the ui in photoshop 

6) If you already done you have to save .TGA file ( don't check compressed option)

7) Open unreal engine 4.25

8) Create new project  Game -> blank -> No starter content

9) Delet all of thing with starter on World Outliner

10) Create folder "NameOfMod/BNSR/Content/Art/UI/"

11) pull your mod folder "GameUI" and "GameUI_BNSR" to folder "UI" in unreal engine

12) option  Edit -> project edit -> packaging -> uncheck "use pack file"

13) save with  file -> save all

14)  option  File -> package project -> win64 -> create folder "Render" to contain -> select folder

15) after done you mod folder will in the unreal project " Render\WindowsNoEditor\NameOfFolder\Content"

16) to be save create new folder and pull your mod folder in it

17) take your mod folder to repack with unrealPack. You will get .pak file

18) then take some of .SIG file from another mod and rename it follow wit "_p"
	.pak and .SIG file must have same name!!
